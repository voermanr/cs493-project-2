# Assignment 3

The goal of this assignment is to incorporate authorization and
authentication into our businesses API.  There are a few parts to this
assignment, as described below.

You are provided some starter code in this repository that implements a
MySQL/Sequelize-based solution to assignment 2.  The starter code
contains the following components:
* An API server is implemented in `server.js`.
* Individual API routes are modularized within the `api/` directory.
* Sequelize models are implemented in the `models/` directory.
* Tests and a testing environment for the API are included in the
  `tests/` directory. You can import these tests into either Postman
  or Insomnia and build on them if you like. Note that, depending on
  where you're running your API server, you may need to update the
  `baseUrl` variable in the included testing environment to reflect
  the URL for your own server.
* A script in `initDb.js` that populates the database with initial
  data from the `data/` directory.  You can run this script by running
  `npm run initdb`.
* A Docker Compose specification in `compose.yml`.  This specification
  will launch the entire application from scratch, including
  populating the database using `initDb.js`.  Note that if you use
  this specification to launch the app, the `db-init` service and the
  `api` service will fail with an error (`ECONNREFUSED`) and be
  restarted continually until the database service is running and the
  database server itself is ready to accept connections.  Note that
  the Docker Compose specification relies on some environment
  variables being set in the included `.env` file.

Feel free to use this code as your starting point for this assignment.
You may also use your own solution to assignment 2 as your starting
point if you like, or you may convert the existing solution to use
MongoDB.  If you do either of those things, you must ensure that your
API implementation matches the one from the starter code (i.e. it has
all the same endpoints, etc.).

## 1. Implement an API endpoint for creating new users

Your first task for this assignment is to implement an API endpoint to
enable the creation and storage of application users.  Specifically, you
should create a `POST /users` API endpoint through which new users can
register.  When a user registers, they should provide their name, email
address, and password, and you should salt and hash the password on the
server before storing it.

If you work with the starter code for this assignment, you'll need to
create a Sequelize `User` model to represent users.  If you work with
another version of the code, you'll have to model users in an
appropriate way.  However you do it, you should store the following
information for each user:

* `id` - The primary key for the user (if you're using MongoDB, it's
  fine to stick with the default primary key name `_id`)
* `name` - User's full name
* `email` - User's email address (which must be unique among all
  users)
* `password` - User's hashed/salted password
* `admin` - A boolean flag indicating whether the user has
  administrative permissions (`false` by default)

Importantly, you'll need to make sure you hash and salt users passwords
before storing them in your database.  If you stick with the Sequelize
implementation from the starter code, the easiest way to do this is to
use a [Sequelize
setter](https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/core-concepts/getters-setters-virtuals/#setters)
for your password field.

Also, note that the starter code contains some user data in
`data/users.json`, which you can use to populate some initial users into
your database.  If you're using the starter code's Sequelize
implementation and populate your database using `initDb.js`, you can add
additional code there to populate the users table in a manner similar to
the way business, review, and photo data is populated using
`bulkCreate()`.  If you do this, the values of the `ownerId` field in
the initial business data should map to the correct users from the
initial user data.

Finally, note that you may have to manually connect to the database
(e.g. using the MySQL terminal monitor) to insert at least one user with
administrative permissions (i.e. for whom the `admin` flag is `true`).
If you do this, you can use the following pre-salted/hashed version of
the password "hunter2":

```
$2a$08$Y00/JO/uN9n0dHKuudRX2eKksWMIHXDLzHWKuz/K67alAYsZRRike
```

## 2. Enable JWT-based user logins and implement a user data access endpoint

Once you have enabled user registration for your application, implement
a new `POST /users/login` API endpoint that allows a registered user to
log in by sending their email address and password.  If the
email/password combination is valid, you should respond with a JWT
token, which the user can then send with future requests to authenticate
themselves.  The JWT token payload should contain the user's ID (with
which you should be able to fetch details about the user from the
database) and any other information needed to implement the features
described in this assignment, and it should expire after 24 hours.

If a user attempts to log in with an invalid username or password, you
should respond with a 401 error.

In addition, you should create a `GET /users/{userId}` API endpoint that
returns information about the specified user (excluding their password).

## 3. Require authorization to perform certain API actions

Once users can log in, modify your API to implement the following
authorization scheme:
* Only an authorized user can see their own user data and their own
  lists of businesses, reviews, and photos.  In other words, the
  following API endpoints should verify that the `userId` specified in
  the URL path matches the ID of the logged-in user (as indicated by a
  valid JWT provided by the client):
    * `GET /users/{userId}`
    * `GET /users/{userId}/businesses`
    * `GET /users/{userId}/photos`
    * `GET /users/{userId}/reviews`

* Only an authorized user can create new businesses, reviews, and
  photos.  In other words, the following API endpoints must ensure
  that a user is logged in and that the user ID specified in the POST
  request body matches the ID of the logged-in user:
    * `POST /businesses`
    * `POST /photos`
    * `POST /reviews`

* Only an authorized user can modify or delete their own businesses,
  reviews, and photos.  In other words, the following API endpoints
  must ensure that a user is logged in and that the user ID for the
  entity being modified/deleted matches the ID of the logged-in user:
    * `PUT /businesses`, `DELETE /businesses`
    * `PUT /photos`, `DELETE /photos`
    * `PUT /reviews`, `DELETE /reviews`

* A user with `admin` permissions may perform any action, including
  creating content or fetching/modifying/deleting the content of any
  user.

* Only a user with `admin` permissions may create other `admin` users,
  i.e. the creation of `admin` users must be accompanied by a valid
  JWT for a logged-in `admin` user.

All authorized endpoints should respond with an error if the logged-in
user is not authorized or if no user is logged in (i.e. no JWT is
provided).

## Extra credit: rate limiting

For 10 points of extra credit, you can implement a rate-limiting scheme
that works as follows:

* Requests that do not come from an authenticated user are
  rate-limited on a per-IP address basis.  These unauthenticated
  requests can be made at a rate of 5 requests per minute.

* Requests that come from an authenticated user are rate-limited on a
  per-user basis.  These authenticated requests can be made at a rate
  of 10 requests per minute.

This rate-limiting scheme should be backed by a Redis cache that runs in
a Docker container.  A full specification for the Redis cache should be
added to `compose.yml` so the entire application can still be launched
from scratch using Docker Compose.

## Grading criteria

In order to receive a grade, the following needs to work:

1. Open a new shell, change to the project directory, and export
   necessary environment variables.
2. In that shell, run `docker compose up`.
3. Wait for the app to come up.
4. Open another shell, change to the project directory, and export
   necessary environment variables.
5. In that shell, run `sh ./runtests.sh`.

If you have your own cURL tests, you can put them in `runtests.sh`. If
you are using the supplied Postman tests, put this in your
`runtests.sh`:

```
cd tests
newman run -e api_tests.postman_environment.json api_tests.postman_collection.json
```

(And if you install [`newman`](https://github.com/postmanlabs/newman),
it should run the tests.)

If the steps above fail to appreciably complete, I'll let you know and
you can fix it so I can grade it.

This assignment is worth 100 total points, broken down as follows:

* 30 points: API allows the creation of new users via a `POST /users`
  endpoint

* 25 points: API allows users to log in via a `POST /users/login`
  endpoint

* 5 points: API has a `GET /users/{userId}` endpoint that returns
  appropriate data

* 40 points: API endpoints are authenticated as described above

In addition, you can earn 10 points of extra credit as described above.
